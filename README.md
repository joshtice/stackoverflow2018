## 1. Installation
The StackOverflow survey analysis was completed with Python 3.7 and Jupyter Lab. The analysis required several packages not included in a typical Anaconda distribution of Python:
- XGBoost

## 2. Project Description  
This analysis was submitted as partial fulfillment of the requirements for Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree. The project was an exercise in using the CRISP-DM process to address a set of questions in a data-centric manner. This particular analysis sought to explore the StackOverflow Developers Survey from 2018 and answer several questions. The questions are as follows: 

1. How prevelant are non-Computer Science PhDs in computing-centric fields?
2. What are the top job prospects for this demographic?
3. Which tools are the most important to learn?
4. Is the lack of a Computer Science degree a significant detriment for Ph.D.s?

The analysis showed that few non-Computer Science PhDs were in the dataset, but still pointed to important job opportunities and essential tools for these individuals. Finally, the analysis concluded that most likely, not having a Computer Science degree is not a sizeable detriment to a Ph.D.
